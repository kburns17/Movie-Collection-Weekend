# Movie-Collection-Weekend Project
This is a movie collection application that was built as a weekend project for Prime Digital Academy. 
The app has two views: Add Movies and Manage Genres. 

-With the Add Movies view you can add and delete movies from the collection. The collection will display movie name, genre, runtime, release year, and can format a sourced image of the movie.

-With the Manage Genres view, you can add a new genre to the collection, and that genre will be available on the Add Movie view. 
It also has the ability to delete a genre if it is not in use. As a fail safe, an user is unable to delete a genre that currently has movies in it. 


Future goals for this app are to bring in some angular material, add a sweetalert for the genre delete and potentiall use an API to source the movies.

To build this app, I employed a SEAN stack. SQL, Express, Angular JS, Node JS.
